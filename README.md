# Python review function introduction

### Problem 1
Create a ```printNumbers``` function to print integers from -25 to 20 to the console

### Problem 2
Create a function that’s passed a firstName and lastName. Return lastName comma firstName (Mini Challenge: Print first and last name with 1st letter capitalized)

### Problem 3
Create a function called checkPassword. Send two string variables to the checkPassword function to check if the strings are equal. Return true if they are equal and false if they are not equal. Print the function's return value.

### Problem 4:
##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
Create a function that has a loop that quits with ‘q’. If the user doesn't enter 'q', ask them to input another string.

### Challenge
Create a function that accepts 2 numbers. When the function is called return the sum, difference, product, and quotient as 4 separate return values. Print the 4 results that are returned using f-strings.

Example; If 2 and 6 passed to the function, output should be similar to the following:

```
The sum of 2 + 6 is 8
The difference of 2 - 6 is  -4
The product of 2 * 6 is 12
The quotient of 2 / 6 is .333
```
